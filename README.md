# FlashLoan-Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to use the FlashLoan contract to get 100 ether on the RichGetRicher contract and transfer the NFT on this contract to one's own wallet. It took me days to solve this challenge. After finding a working solution, it took a bit more time to make it as error-free as possible. During this challenge, I researched and applied a lot about interfaces. The most challenging part for me was understanding the usage and logic behind interfaces.

# FlashLoan-Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to use the FlashLoan contract to meet the requirement of acquiring 100 ether on the RichGetRicher contract and transfer the NFT on this contract to one's own wallet. Solving this challenge took me several days. While achieving a functional solution, I spent some more time trying to make it as error-free as possible. In this challenge, I researched and applied various aspects of interfaces. The most challenging part for me was understanding the usage and logic behind interfaces.
Additionally, I also gained knowledge about ERC721 transactions. The most important benefit was understanding the working mechanism of flash loans. This challenge was highly informative for me in terms of understanding flash loans.
